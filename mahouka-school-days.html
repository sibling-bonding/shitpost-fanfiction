    <h1>Mahouka Ending - School Days Edition</h1>
    
    <p>Tatsuya takes Miyuki out for dinner, receiving a call from Honoka who demands to know his whereabouts. He angrily blames her for ruining his life and asks for her to leave his apartment, which she promptly does. On her way home however, she catches sight of Tatsuya and Miyuki on a train together, and returns. In the heat of fighting, Tatsuya and Miyuki make out in front of Honoka, who screams and leaves. Things are worsened later that night, when she receives a text from him insisting she get an abortion. The following day, arranging to talk at his apartment, Honoka brutally stabs Tatsuya to death with a kitchen knife and flees. She receives a text from his phone that night requesting her presence on the school roof, where she meets Miyuki. After presenting her with Tatsuya's severed head, she slits open Honoka's neck with a d≈çzuki, causing her to collapse and die in a fountain of blood. With her former friend out of commission, Miyuki carves into Honoka's uterus, but sees no fetus in there according to Miyuki's soliloquy. Early that morning, floating into a sunrise on a sailboat, Miyuki is seen cuddling Tatsuya's severed head whispering that they can finally be together.</p>
